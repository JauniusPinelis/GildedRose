1. Adding GildedRose Project Files.
2. Giving project a structure: dividing into 3 projects:
	Business - ClassLibrary for store logic, entities, and etc
	Console - UI
	UnitTests - XUnitTests for Test Driven Development
3. Removing original console project, original tests as they are not much use currently.
4. Fixing namespaces, adding references to Business projects and making other changes to make sure the solution builds.
5. The solutions now builds and run - tests will be added before any more refactoring takes place.
6. Adding Unit Tests for Normal item.
7. Adding Unit Tests for Sulfuras item.
8. Adding Unit Tests for Aged Brie item.
9. Adding Unit Tests for BackStagePass item.
10. Tests have been added and they all pass - now it should (hopefully..) be safe to refactor.
11. for -> foreach
12. "item.SellIn = item.SellIn - 1" -> "item.sellin -=1" and similar.
13. Refactor 'item.Quality = item.Quality - item.Quality;'
14. Will be fiddling with if statements: the aim is to isolate behaviour/ updates of each item.
15. Replacing 'not equal' if statements with 'equal'
16. Separating item.Name == 'Aged Brie' || item.Name == 'Backstage passes to a TAFKAL80ETC concert',
 merging some if statement together and removing unnecessary 'if' statements.
17. Extracting Sulfuras functionality to main 'foreach' loop
