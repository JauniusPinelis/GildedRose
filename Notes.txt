1. Adding GildedRose Project Files.
2. Giving project a structure: dividing into 3 projects:
	Business - ClassLibrary for store logic, entities, and etc
	Console - UI
	UnitTests - XUnitTests for Test Driven Development
3. Removing original console project, original tests as they are not much use currently.
4. Fixing namespaces, adding references to Business projects and making other changes to make sure the solution builds.
