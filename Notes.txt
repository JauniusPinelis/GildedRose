1. Adding GildedRose Project Files.
2. Giving project a structure: dividing into 3 projects:
	Business - ClassLibrary for store logic, entities, and etc
	Console - UI
	UnitTests - XUnitTests for Test Driven Development
3. Removing original console project, original tests as they are not much use currently.
